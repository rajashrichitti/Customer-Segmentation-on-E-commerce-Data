# Customer-Segmentation-on-E-commerce-Data

The project focuses on customer segmentation, a process that involves dividing a company's customers into groups based on shared characteristics. Customer segmentation plays a crucial role in optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer relationships. By utilizing extensive data on current and potential customers, this study aims to accurately identify distinct consumer groups based on demographic, behavioral, and other relevant attributes. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that can anticipate future purchases by new customers using an E-commerce database containing purchase records of approximately 4000 customers over a one-year period. The findings and insights gained from this analysis will help optimize customer value and inform targeted marketing strategies. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
